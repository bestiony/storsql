Create a table of products and insert 20 rows with the Id of that product, the name and the price of it into the table using a form that takes the needed data and submits it into that table.

- Connect to database using object oriented notation.
- Display only the first 10 products on another display page.
- Display the last record inserted to the table on the display page.
- Search about a specific product and display it on the display page, for example:
  - return all products that have a price more than 5$ using the suitable query statement.
- Use sanitization and escaping functions to secure your program.
